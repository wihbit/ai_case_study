# [SuperAnnotate](https://www.superannotate.com/)

## Overview and Origin

* SuperAnnotate was founded in late 2018 by brothers Tigran and Vahan Petrosyan after they dropped out of their PhD programs. <sup>[1]</sup>
* Vahan, as a student, had created an accurate superpixel algorithm but couldn't see any practical application for it. He then attended the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference, where businesses in the data annotation industry began offering to buy Vahan's algorithm from him, which led him to realize that fast data annotation was the lucrative practical application he had been looking for. He then convinced his brother, Tigran, to join him in developing their own data annotation platform. <sup>[2]</sup>
* Aside from revenue generated by their main product, SuperAnnotate is funded by venture capital investments. They first received $3 million in seed funding from Point Nine Capital in June 2020, then another $14.5 million from Base10 Partners in July 2021. <sup>[1]</sup>

## Business Activities

* SuperAnnotate seeks to streamline and optimize data annotation, helping customers improve the performance of their machine learning models, and spend less time and money creating the datasets used to train their models. <sup>[3]</sup>
* Data annotation is often a tedious process. For example, training object recognition models for computer vision often requires that a human being take thousands of images, manually draw bounding boxes around objects of interest in them, and annotate attributes about them. <sup>[4]</sup> SuperAnnotate employs various AI/ML strategies to mitigate, sometimes eliminate the manual work that goes into this process.
* SuperAnnotate's target customers are individuals and enterprises that develop machine learning applications <sup>[5]</sup>. The most popular use case is specifically with image annotations for computer vision, but SuperAnnotate also has tools for annotating audio, text, and other data formats. <sup>[3]</sup>
* According to [GlobalNewswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/03/23/2632997/28124/en/Data-Annotation-and-Labeling-Global-Market-Report-2023-Increasing-Need-to-Improve-Machine-Learning-Models-and-Train-AI-Algorithms-Boosts-Growth.html):
  >Any model or system that relies on a computer-driven decision-making system must annotate and label the data in order to guarantee that the decisions are accurate and pertinent. Businesses use massive amounts of datasets when building an ML model, carefully customizing them according to the model training needs. 

  SuperAnnotate and companies like it are addressing the demand to make data annotation cheaper, faster, and more accurate.
* SuperAnnotate's edge over many competitors is that they are leveraging AI to accelerate data annotation. Some competitors strictly offer data annotation as a service rather than a tool that they can put in the customer's hands <sup>[6]</sup>. Other competitors offer data annotation tools that are not AI-driven and require much more time and manual input from the user. <sup>[7]</sup>
* SuperAnnotate employs a large range of technologies and algorithms to enhance the data annotation process, including but not limited to: <sup>[3]</sup>
  * Object detection
  * Pose estimation
  * Optical character recognition
  * Segmentation
  * Object tracking and localization
  * Action detection
  * Sentiment analysis
  * Summarization
  * Translation
  * Named-entity recognition
  * Speech recognition
  * Speaker recognition
  * Sound event detection
  * Content analysis

## Landscape

* SuperAnnotate is in the data annotation field, which is a smaller part of the software development and AI field.
* Data annotation was a $800 million industry in 2022 and is growing at an estimated 33% per year, expected to be a $3.6 billion industry in 2027 <sup>[8]</sup>
* Key drivers of data annotation growth are: <sup>[8]</sup>
  * demand to improve ML models
  * demand for annotated datasets in autonomous mobility technologies
  * rising popularity of labeled data in medical imaging
* Key restraints to data annotation growth, which SuperAnnotate addresses:
  * high costs of manual data annotation
  * poor quality of training data
* Some other major companies in this field are Amazon (Mechanical Turk), LabelBox, Kili Technology, Hive, Appen, and KeyMakr <sup>[9] [10]</sup>

## Results

* SuperAnnotate's company valuation has grown 7,500% in the last 5 years. <sup>[11]</sup>
* Their website cites four main case studies where SuperAnnotate successfully provided a solution to various companies' annotation needs. SuperAnnotate empowered these companies to achieve higher accuracy than their competitors, reduce data annotation timelines, speed up quality assurance, and reduce overall project costs.  <sup>[12] [13] [14] [15]</sup>
* According to LabelVisor, SuperAnnotate ranks #1 in their list of the top 7 annotation providers in 2024, based on pricing and user reviews. <sup>[9]</sup>

## Recommendations

* Since SuperAnnotate still requires users to be doing their own annotations via their software, perhaps they could offer an optional service that outsources annotations to independent contractors.
* Every software has a learning curve, and some companies may simply not want to be bothered with having to learn it. The company could hire independent contractors who know the ins and out of the software well enough to perform annotations even faster.
* Annotation jobs could be posted to an online portal, where eligible freelancers would be free to pick up jobs and complete them. It would be similar to how DoorDash drivers are assigned deliveries.
